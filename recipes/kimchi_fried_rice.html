    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Kimchi fried rice is a popular South Korean dish made with (you guessed it!) kimchi and rice. The
        budget-friendly, easy-to-make meal is a great way to use leftover rice.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Oils: Cook the beef in canola oil and use sesame oil for flavor.</li>
        <li>Beef: This recipe calls for ground beef, but any meat will work.</li>
        <li>Green onion: Cook the white parts of the green onion with the beef, then garnish the kimchi fried rice with
            the green parts.</li>
        <li>Kimchi: Use store-bought or homemade kimchi.</li>
        <li>Gochujang: Spice things up with gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste).</li>
        <li>Rice: You’ll need three cups of cooked short-grain white rice.</li>
        <li>Butter: Cook the egg in a teaspoon of butter.</li>
        <li>Egg: Top the kimchi fried rice with an over-easy egg.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>Here’s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade kimchi fried rice:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the beef and the white parts of the green onion in canola oil.</li>
        <li>Add the kimchi and gochujang, cook until warmed through, then stir in the rice.</li>
        <li>Cook until the rice is heated through, then finish with sesame oil and green onions.</li>
        <li>Cook the egg and serve it over the kimchi fried rice.</li>
    </ol>
